title: "Women's Soccer Data"
---

We'll use this notebook to explore some NCAA women's soccer data and [our questions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G1AjH2iS6kj3kKHCRi0XVy5Lcm-rahJkeTAToVh9J1g/edit?gid=0#gid=0). First, let's load the tidyverse library:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

We'll want to start with 2025 match data, which is located in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/dwillis/NCAAWomensSoccerData). We can load the match data directly from GitHub using `read_csv`:


```{r}
matches_2025 <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/NCAAWomensSoccerData/main/data/ncaa_womens_soccer_matchstats_2025.csv")
```

Let's take a look at this data to see what it contains, using `head` and `glimpse`:

```{r}
head(matches_2025)
glimpse(matches_2025)
```

Now, onto the questions using aggregates, which means `group_by` and `summarize`:

1. How many shots in total has Maryland attempted and how many have been on goal? Calculate a percentage of shots on goal.

```{r}
 matches_2025 |> 
  filter(team == "Maryland Terrapins, Terps") |> 
  summarise(
    total_shots = sum(sh_att),
    total_sog = sum(so_g),
    sog_pct = total_sog/total_shots * 100
  ) 
```
The Terps had 83 shots, and 45 on goal for a percentage of 54.2.

2. What about the same shot stats from last season's first four games? You'll need to load the matches from 2024 - just change the season in the URL - and filter by date to find the first four games.

```{r}
matches_2024 <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/NCAAWomensSoccerData/main/data/ncaa_womens_soccer_matchstats_2024.csv")

matches_2024 |> 
filter(team == "Maryland Terrapins, Terps", 
         date >= as.Date("2024-08-15") & date <= as.Date("2024-08-25")
  ) |> 
   summarise(
    total_shots = sum(sh_att),
    total_sog = sum(so_g),
    sog_pct = total_sog/total_shots * 100
  ) 

```
In the first four games of 2024 the Terps put up 38 shots and 20 on goal for a percentage of 52%

3. Maryland started 2022 with 4 draws. Have any other teams had as many this season?

```{r}
matches_2025 |> 
  filter(outcome == "Draw") |> 
  group_by(team) |> 
  summarise(
  draws = n()
  ) |> 
  arrange(desc(draws))
```
Yes Cal Poly is leading the country with five draws (in more games obviously). 

4. How many total corner kicks has Maryland had so far this season and how many have its opponents have? Calculate the difference between the two totals for every team using group_by, summarize and mutate, then filter to find Maryland's totals.

```{r}
corners_2025 <- matches_2025 |> 
  group_by(team) |> 
  summarise(
    off_corners = sum(corners),
    def_corners = sum(defensive_corners),
  ) |> 
  mutate(diff_corners= off_corners-def_corners)
```
```
Maryland has won 28 offensive corners while allowing 22 for a positive differential of six. 

5. What's the most interesting thing you've seen from these questions?

The most interesting thing I've found in these questions is a coorelation between the teams with the best corner differential and teams with positive records. The top five teams in corner differnetial have just two losses between them and both are to Illinois, who interestingly enough are undefeated with a corner differential of -12. I think this could lead to an interesting story on Illinois's tactics, do they prioritize building attacks through the middle? Are they more willing to concede corners defensively? I think these could be interesting things to look at through game tape and/or questions with their coach.
